## Overview ##

There are reasons to choose either AMD or Nvidia (or, soon, Intel) graphics
cards.  Nvidia has the largest market share, and because of this, certain
games may be more optimized for these cards.  However, there are no games
of any quality that will _only_ run on one or the other, so the choice
truly is up to you.

Personally, I like AMD.  The cards are generally a bit more 'bang for buck'
(though that is starting to change as they get more popular). This is the only
non-subjective reason I choose them.  Subjectively, I like that they are kind of
the underdog compared to Nvidia, which has vastly more market share, and because
they are much more involved in supporting opensource, both in general (vulcan
apis, driver stack, etc), and specifically supporting linux, which is important
to me. In addition to the information below, Tom's Hardware has a good
[overview](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gpu-hierarchy,4388.html). They
link to additional reviews of specific cards.  In general, Gigabyte and Asus are
highly regarded for quality products. The kids have MSI cards (and my 1050Ti is
MSI as well), but I was underwhelmed with the quality of their x470
motherboards, and am unsure if this quality control issue extends to the
graphics cards they make as well.


## AMD ##

I am running a [Gigyabte Radeon RX
570](https://www.newegg.com/gigabyte-radeon-rx-570-gv-rx570gaming-4gd/p/N82E16814125966).
Unlike the motherboards, which have come down in price, this has gone up
substantially due to supply shortages.  This card was $120 when I bought it, and
now that link shows it only sold by 3rd party sellers, starting at $630! These
cards may simply be getting more expensive because they are not being produced
anymore, you can see few have any prices/availability if you look on
[pcpartpicker](https://pcpartpicker.com/products/video-card/#c=392). This card
now has 2 newer generations, so it is really only worth considering if you can
get one for what I paid or less.  The 5000 series and 6000 series have
superceded it, and are built on a brand new, (much more highly regarded)
architecture. If you are looking at either of these, the biggest difference is
the 6000 series has hardware support for ray tracing.  If super realistic
reflective and high FPS are not a priority, this may not matter to you, and both
are good cards. A note on naming scheme.  Taking the 6000 series, and
specifically a RX6900 XT, you can break it down like this:
* RX - means nothing, just the way they name all the cards
* 6 - generation of the card, so 6 is the one newer than 5, and the next one
  will be 7.  Also, if the full model has 4 digits, it is the new RDNA
  architecture, if 3, then it is the older (and completely different, generally
  not viewed as nearly as good from design standpoint) arch.
* 9 - place within the specified generation of cards. 9 is the highest end card,
  and they decrease as they become more mainstream or budget (I believe the
  lowest current number is 6).
- 00 - these are generally not used for anything, though they could perhaps be
  used to slot something between say, a 6800 and 6900
- XT - this denotes a slightly higher end version of a given model.

## Nivida ##

The kids have Nvidia cards, [RTX
2060s](https://www.newegg.com/msi-geforce-rtx-2060-rtx-2060-gaming-z-6g/p/N82E16814137379)
to be specific. Note that I have a spare MSI GTX 1050Ti, which is probably
around the same quality of graphics as the RX 570 described above. For Nvidia,
I will start with the naming scheme, using RTX 3060 Ti as the example.
* RTX - This denotes it is one of the (currently 2) newer generations of card,
  which have hardware support for Ray Tracing, like the rx6000 series. Previous
  generations were called GTX.  Some of those can support ray tracing, but is is
  software based instead of hardware.
* 3 - As with AMD, this denotes the generation.  RTX is 2 or 3, GTX was 1, and
  before the 1000 series, it was the same, but simply in 3 digits instead of 4.
* 0 - currently means nothing.
* 6 - place within the lineup of a given generation.  Similar to AMD (or vice
  versa), these numbers run generally 6-9, with cost and perforamance increasing
  with the number.
* 0 - currently means nothing.
* Ti - A card that has this designation, is generally a mid-year update geared
  towards gaming.  It may have some minor tweaks to make it faster than the
  non-Ti version.

As previously mentioned, prices for new cards are currently astronomical.  In
normal times, you can get a decent card in the low-to-mid $100 range, with many
choices as you move up through the various performance levels.
