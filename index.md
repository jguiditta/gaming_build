### Intro ###

Hello, and welcome to the build guide I didn't intend to make!  This started as
an email, and I quickly realized there was _WAY_ too much information I had
accumulated to share that way.  Building a gaming PC can be a fun and rewarding
process, but the key is to take your time, learn about the components, research
what companies are good for different things, and be aware of where to watch
out for compatibility issues. If you do your research and are thorough, you will
be rewarded with an end result that is both fun to use, nice to look at, and
something to be proud that you built yourself - not to mention that you will
have a much better idea of what is happening on the inside of the machine than
if you simply purchase a pre-built computer.

### Resources ###

This is a good way to check if your components are likely to be compatible:
[PC Partpicker](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/). 
Here you can add any components you are considering, and save the list for 
future reference (it automatically creates a unique url for you, no account
needed).

### Good Guides and Reviews ###

Hardware reviews and building guides:

* [JayzTwoCents](https://www.youtube.com/c/Jayztwocents) - entertaining
   reviews. Reminds me of someone I know.
* [Hardware Unboxed](https://www.youtube.com/c/Hardwareunboxednow) - Good
   details on motherboard and monitor reviews especially.
* [Gamers Nexus](https://www.youtube.com/c/GamersNexus) - very detailed
   reviews (sometimes a little _too_ detailed)
* [Paul's Hardware](https://www.youtube.com/c/paulshardware) - Paul has
   a number of build guides
   [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRnHcRQUxuoeQM4-llcMNXTakKZcAAyB6).
* [PC Perspective](https://pcper.com) - Sebastion Peak in particular has some
  very detailed reviews.
* [Tom's Hardware](https://www.tomshardware.com/) - Good for overviews and
  buying guides in addition to reviews of individual products.
* [Anandtech](https://www.anandtech.com/) - Though Anand is no longer here, they
  still have good reviews and some technical deep dives, especially on CPUs,
  GPUs and motherboards.


### Parts Suggestions ###

Here I recommend some specific models, both ones I have had good experiences
with, and some that should be avoided. Note that prices for some of these have
come down, or newer models have become available since I did our builds.

#### Motherboard/CPU ####

This guide describes the AMD/AM4 platform options, as this is what I have used.
Details [here](/motherboards).


#### Graphics Card ####

You can Go with either Nvidia or AMD, either works fine, just a matter of
preference. Details [here](/graphics).

#### RAM ####

The key thing with RAM is to make sure whatever you are considering is on the
list of compatible models from the site of the motherboard maker of your choice.
On our first build, I made the mistake of just looking at the RAM speed, and
ended up with something that ran, but would have run much better if I had paid
more careful attention to the compatability chart. They are called a QVL, or
Qualified Vendor List, and should be available from the motherboard
manufacturer's website (and sometimes the RAM maker will have a list, but the
former is generally better to use).  As an example, you can see the list for my
X570 board
[here](https://www.asus.com/motherboards-components/motherboards/tuf-gaming/tuf-gaming-x570-plus-wi-fi/HelpDesk_QVL/).

Generally speaking, you will probably want to look at DDR4 in the 3200MHz or
greater range. I have been very happy with G.Skill as a brand. I had one quality
issue, and they promptly and without issue replaced the faulty stick. Money can
be saved here by choosing a model that does not have RGB lighting. If you do
choose lighting, the Trident Z (Neo for AMD) line is a good balance of quality
and price. One compatible model for the RoG motherboard I describe elsewhere is
[this
one](https://www.newegg.com/g-skill-16gb-288-pin-ddr4-sdram/p/N82E16820232859).
[Ripjaws](https://www.newegg.com/g-skill-16gb-288-pin-ddr4-sdram/p/N82E16820232090)
is a good non-rgb option.  

#### Storage ####

This is an area where cost can be saved.  The categories you can choose from are
M.2 NVMe (internal ssd stick that sockets into the motherboard), SATA SSD, or
spinning HDD - decreasing in cost in this order. For M.2, I have been happy with
the [Intel 660p
Series](https://www.newegg.com/intel-660p-series-512gb/p/0D9-002V-003Y7), and
[Crucial P1](https://www.newegg.com/crucial-p1-500gb/p/N82E16820156200).  Both
currently run about $63 for the 500GB class. 

![crucial_p1](/assets/images/crucial_p1.jpg)

Often, the SATA SSDs are less expensive, though currently it doesn't appear to
be by much.  Western Digital's
[Blue](https://www.amazon.com/Blue-NAND-250GB-SSD-WDS250G2B0A/dp/B073SBZ8YH?th=1)
line has been good in my experience. For HDD, WD in the Blue or Black lines have
also been reliable, and you can get a [1TB
Drive](https://www.newegg.com/blue-wd10ezex-1tb/p/N82E16822236339) for about
$43.  Also, you can mix and match drives over time as needed, one option being
to have your OS installed on your fastest drive, and using the spinning drive
for storage of larger files, like games. I have not had good experience with
Seagate or Toshiba drives.

#### Power Supply ####

For power supply, the biggest things are to get a good quality one that will
provide reliable, clean power (no, not all do!), and to make sure that you have
enough wattage to cover your current (and planned upgrade) needs.  Graphics
cards tend to take a fair amount of power, so if you go with a modest one to
start, and later want to get something more powerful, you don't want to also
have to upgrade your power supply. If you use pcpartpicker to help spec out your
build, it will give you an estimate of the required wattage as a starting point,
based on your choices.  Generally, it is a good idea to go a bit above this, if
price is not a major issue.  650-850 watts is generally all that is needed.
None but the most expensive machines need 1K or greater.  Ours are all either
650 or 750. See [here](/psu) for more details.


#### Case ####

Cases are, to me, the most fun part of the build to pick, since you will look at
them every day.  They are nothing like the cases of old, where they were simply
a plain grey, white, or black box with some ports and a power button.  They are
highly personal, and are designed to show off your build, and often, provide
some fun, customizable lighting.  You can do fun things, like change the color
based on the game you are playing or music you are listening to. You can even
set one for when you don't want to be disturbed, so it is easy for someone to
see 'Oh, they have bright green on, that means they are working'. Let's get into
the [details](/cases)! Note that on most modern cases, the front ports are on
the top or top/front.

### Tips and Tricks ###

I am starting this section with just a few things I can think of, but I hope
to remember more that I can add as needed.

* Fan orientation - make sure the case fans are actually pointing in the
  direction you think! I have hooked them up and started the computer, only to
  find out they were pointing opposite of what I thought.
* Anti-static wrist bands are not neccessary so long as you are careful to
  ground yourself by touching the case before touching any electronic component.
  They are, however, fairly inexpensive, and a worthwhile backup in case you
  forget to touch the case.
* AMD CPUs come with a cooler, so unless you want to get fancy, this is not
  something you need to buy separately.
* LED fans and non-LED fans have different terminals they plug in with (usually
  3 or 4).  Make sure you check to see you have the proper place to plug them in
  if you buy extras (I added
  [this](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07NHQRCRM) fan controller and
  [this](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00M0R9BV0) splitter to my system
  because I was not aware of this when I got my extra fans).
* CPUs have _very_ delicate pins, and are ZIF (Zero Insertion Force) - that
  means if you have to press _AT ALL_ when inserting to the socket, something is
  wrong.  Stop immediately and check the orientation of CPU to motherboard.
