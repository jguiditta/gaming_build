### Good Guides and Reviews ###

Hardware reviews and building guides:

* [JayzTwoCents](https://www.youtube.com/c/Jayztwocents) - entertaining
   reviews. Reminds me of someone I know.
* [Hardware Unboxed](https://www.youtube.com/c/Hardwareunboxednow) - Good
   details on motherboard and monitor reviews especially.
* [Gamers Nexus](https://www.youtube.com/c/GamersNexus) - very detailed
   reviews (sometimes a little _too_ detailed)
* [Paul's Hardware](https://www.youtube.com/c/paulshardware) - Paul has
   a number of build guides

### Parts Suggestions ###

Here I recommend some specific models, both ones I have had good experiences
with, and ones that should be avoided. Note that prices for some of these have
come down, or newer models have become available.

#### Motherboard ####

* [Asus ROG Strix B550-F Gaming](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B088W7RKVZ)
  - B550s are considered 'mid range', but they are generally more than
    sufficient for gaming and other uses.  There may be slightly fewer sata
    connections allowed, which is only an issue if you plan to hook up tons of
    drives, and the don't support PCIe 4, which is not an issue, but almost
    nothing else supports it yet either (including graphics cards). Some high
    end NVMe storage supports it, but that is pro level stuff.
  - This has some lighting, inlcuding the RoG logo, which may be a plus or
    minus, depending what you like.
  - Prices vary, this was $178 when we got it.

* [Asus TUF Gaming X570-Plus](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07SXFK1TP)
  - The TUF Gaming series has a bit of a different aesthetic, using black with
    yellow highlights, and less lighting.  There is also a 
    [B550](https://smile.amazon.com/ASUS-TUF-B550-PLUS-Motherboard-Addressable/dp/B088W57M4J)
    model, which looks more readily available than this X570, and costs a bit
    less.  I don't have personal experience with this one, so definitely check
    the reviews.
  - This ran about $200 at one point, the B550 model looks to be about $160.
